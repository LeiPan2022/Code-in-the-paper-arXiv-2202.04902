This project contains four main folders:

1. PXP model
The files in this folder calculate the overlap, \sigma_z and entanglement entropy of the \pi-magnons and the PXP model.
You can run the Matlab code "plot_PXP" in which the system size L is tunable parameter.

2. PPXPP model 
The files in this folder calculate \sigma_z of the 2/3\pi and 4/3\pi magnons and eigenstate states in the PPXPP model and also the overlap between them.
You can run the Matlab code "plot_PPXPP" in which the system size L is tunable parameter.

3. Single Magnon Spectrum  
The files in this folder calculate the single-magnon excitation spectrum in the PXP model and the PPXPP model.
You can run the Matlab code "Plot_Single_Magnon_Spectrum" in which the system size L is tunable parameter.

4. Transition
The files in this folder calculate all the data in Fig.4 of the paper which include optimal v for magnon wave function, the overlap between magnon wave function and the ground state obtained by ED, the gap of magnon excitation and the domain wall density and variance in the PXP model with finite detuning.
You can run the Matlab code "plot_transition" in which the system size L and the parameter range "Detuning" are tunable.
